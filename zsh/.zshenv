# This file is sourced on all invocations of the shell.
# It is the 1st file zsh reads; it's read for every shell,
# even if started with -f (setopt NO_RCS), all other
# initialization files are skipped.
#
# This file should contain commands to set the command
# search path, plus other important environment variables.
# This file should not contain commands that produce
# output or assume the shell is attached to a tty.

# Notice: .zshenv is the same, execpt that it's not read
# if zsh is started with -f
#
# Global Order: zshenv, zprofile, zshrc, zlogin
